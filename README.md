Jate is a text editor application that allows users to write text offline and have it saved in their client side storgae using an indexDB database. It utilizes Webpack to bundle all the resources to be served in production. The Workbox plugin is also used to generate a service worker that fetches static resources from the cache to be served even when there is no network connection.
